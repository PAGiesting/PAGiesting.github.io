### Example Projects

#### Club Soda (Fort Wayne Manufactured Gas Plant), 2019

Manufactured gas plants are notorious historical sites where large quantities of toxic coal tar were (mis)handled according to the “best practices” of the period c. 1890 to 1960. As a subcontractor, PAG Geology handled the examination and analysis of a considerable body of disjointed assessment and investigation work stretching back over decades. The result was a focused plan for eliminating data gaps in the existing knowledge base without duplicating previous effort.

#### Kyrgyz Gold Mining and Extraction, 2019

An investor needed an expert analysis on gold / base metal mining and extraction opportunities in Central Asia. The prospects included not only ore still in the ground, but the opportunity to extract gold from the tailings of 20th century mining for base metals. PAG Geology conducted a thorough evaluation of the information provided on grain size, chemistry, and the extraction process design.

#### Former Industrial Site, Kalihi Kai, 2018

The Kalihi Kai neighborhood of Honolulu is a patchwork of small properties near the commercial docks. The site in question was used for storage and maintenance of pneumatic equipment, and in decades-old litigation an accusation had been made that waste oil had been dumped indiscriminantly on the property. A previous assessment had given some indication that this was the case. A more thorough investigation and hydrologic analysis of the site allowed the construction of a risk assessment, which established that human and ecological risks from the historic dumping were extremely low. This allowed the site to be closed with a restrictive covenant.

#### Kuahea Street Slope Instability, 2015-2017

Two neighbors in Honolulu were disputing their relative responsibility for maintaining a masonry retaining wall. An assessment of the geological literature on O’ahu’s many regions of landsliding, slope creep, and similar phenomena showed that the houses were located in the vicinity of a large historic instability, the Waiomao Slide (to the surprise of the parties involved). Discussions were underway with the City and County of Honolulu regarding liability and remedial action.

#### Waikiki Landing, 2011-2012

The Waikiki Landing project was a redevelopment project on State-owned land in and around Ala Wai Harbor (featured in the intro to Gilligan’s Island). This project involved completing partial environmental investigations, formulating and implementing a cleanup plan for historic petroleum contamination at the old fuel dock. Although the Waikiki Landing project was shelved due to a shift in State interest, the sites involved are now closed and ready for development.
