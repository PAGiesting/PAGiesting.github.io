Example Project
Kuahea Street Slope Instability, 2015-2017

Two neighbors in Honolulu were disputing their relative responsibility for maintaining a masonry retaining wall. An assessment of the geological literature on O’ahu’s many regions of landsliding, slope creep, and similar phenomena showed that the houses were located in the vicinity of a large historic instability, the Waiomao Slide (to the surprise of the parties involved). Discussions were underway with the City and County of Honolulu regarding liability and remedial action.

Example Projects
Waikiki Landing, 2011-2012

The Waikiki Landing project was a redevelopment project on State-owned land in and around Ala Wai Harbor (featured in the intro to Gilligan’s Island). This project involved completing partial environmental investigations, formulating and implementing a cleanup plan for historic petroleum contamination at the old fuel dock. Although the Waikiki Landing project was shelved due to a shift in State interest, the sites involved are now closed and ready for development.
Former Industrial Site, Kalihi Kai, 2018

The Kalihi Kai neighborhood of Honolulu is a patchwork of small properties near the commercial docks. The site in question was used for storage and maintenance of pneumatic equipment, and in decades-old litigation an accusation had been made that waste oil had been dumped indiscriminantly on the property. A previous assessment had given some indication that this was the case. A more thorough investigation and hydrologic analysis of the site allowed the construction of a risk assessment, which established that human and ecological risks from the historic dumping were extremely low. This allowed the site to be closed with a restrictive covenant.
Club Soda (Fort Wayne Manufactured Gas Plant), 2019

Manufactured gas plants are notorious historical sites where large quantities of toxic coal tar were (mis)handled according to the “best practices” of the period c. 1890 to 1960. As a subcontractor, PAG Geology handled the examination and analysis of a considerable body of disjointed assessment and investigation work stretching back over decades. The result was a focused plan for eliminating data gaps in the existing knowledge base without duplicating previous effort.

Example Project
Kyrgyz Gold Mining and Extraction

An investor needed an expert analysis on gold / base metal mining and extraction opportunities in Central Asia. The prospects included not only ore still in the ground, but the opportunity to extract gold from the tailings of 20th century mining for base metals. PAG Geology conducted a thorough evaluation of the information provided on grain size, chemistry, and the extraction process design.

Continual Steel: Executive Summary
ContinentalSteel
Continental Steel in operation. (Photo from Kokomo Tribune.)

Continental Steel was a sprawling industrial facility situated along Wildcat Creek at its junction with Kokomo Creek on Markland Avenue on the west side of Kokomo. At least in its later stages of operation (under various names, and as part of various conglomerates, it ran for the vast bulk of the 20th century) it used electric furnaces to melt scrap steel and make wire, fence and nails…products where the metal quality need not be that high.

When the plant closed in 1986, it left behind a huge and varied collection of contaminated sites. The US EPA divided it into a number of “OUs” (operating units) that had to be dealt with in very different ways:

    The Main Plant, where nearly all the actual steelmaking and processing took place.
    The “evaporation” lagoons, where concentrated, contaminated sulfuric acid from the pickling process did NOT evaporate but sank into the ground.
    Markland Quarry, an old hole in the ground where they threw anything they didn’t want to run through the furnaces, including drums and drums of dirty TCE solvent as well as at least one piece of WWII ordinance.
    The “Slag Processing Area,” another old quarry where the slag, or rocky froth left over from steelmaking, was dumped and allowed to erode into the creek.
    Wildcat Creek and Kokomo Creek themselves, where the sediment was impregnated with toxic metals, solvent, hydrocarbons, and PCBs. There were lots of PCBs at the site within transformers used to manage electricity to melt steel and accomplish other tasks.
    The limestone aquifer beneath the site, where the solvent wound up after being dumped in Markland Quarry or elsewhere.

Continental Steel made it onto the NPL and became a Superfund site in 1989. There were no, or almost no, assets left over from the company after it was liquidated; in fact, its workers’ pensions disappeared in the bankruptcy as well. The American taxpayer has footed the bill for almost all the prodigious amount of work done at the site over the years.

The buildings at the Main Plant were demolished in 1999-2000. When I joined IDEM in 2006, work was set to begin on another intense phase of work. The first task was covering the Main Plant area with a cover of soil to at least provide some kind of buffer between the residual contamination and people at the surface. Markland Quarry was dug out, with a large amount of contaminated soil and junk removed so it would stop releasing contaminants to the aquifer. The creeks were dredged, which was a massive undertaking. As I recall a low-head dam in Wildcat Creek (which is really a medium-sized river) by the Kokomo wastewater treatment plant was removed and found to have drums of waste oil inside it to provide bulk and a convenient disposal location.

This site was insane. I’ll give you a more detailed example in the next post.

After I left in 2009, the site apparently got a shot in the arm from some Obama stimulus money, and a lot of further work has been done. It’s mostly usable now, and after a lot of agonzing about how (and whether) to reuse the site, in recent years, a solar array has been installed.

That said, the contamination in the aquifer can’t be removed by any practical means. Just like Galen Myers, it’s going to have to be allowed to migrate out, but unlike Galen Myers, we’re going to have to pump it out for a very long time. Kokomo is a place where the bedrock is unusually close to the surface (for northern Indiana) and quarries downstream from the plant have to pump out water to keep operating. After they finish their practical lifetime, EPA and/or IDEM are going to keep pumping for a very long time… at least, that was the plan when I left.

Galen Myers: To Infinity

Meanwhile, back in Osceola (where the wind comes sweeping down the postglacial plain)…

One core feature of the Superfund program is the Five Year Review. So long as any residual contamination remains from a site above some pretty low estimated risk level, someone has to complete a Five Year Review every, well, five years ad infinitum to keep us all up to date on the situation.

I have to think that in 1980 the writers of the CERCLA legislation that started the Superfund program did not anticipate so many sites would take so long to clean up. At some point, I suspect the Five Year Review restriction will be relaxed for sites like Galen Myers, where not much is changing and it’s quite difficult to imagine a surprise coming up. In the meantime, the cost of hiring a consultant to do your Five Year Review is a not insignificant part of the effective penalty for contaminating a site so intensely as to put it on the NPL… unless, of course, you’re Galen Myers, and you conveniently got out of the way, leaving the cost burden to us.

The most recent Five Year Review (5YR) for Galen Myers is on the EPA website. Let’s grade my memories against the records on pp. 26-28:

Galen Myers operated from c. 1970 – 1983 (check). The country board of health heard complaints in 1981, kicked them up to the Indiana State Board of Health (IDEM would not be split off until 1986), who investigated and called in the EPA. EPA stopped by and actually talked to the man himself in June 1983, but he died shortly thereafter. (So my memories there were vague, and the situation blew up before GM left the scene.) In 1984 the place was already abandoned. The 5YR does not comment on any transfer of ownership.

Several rounds of sampling and cleanup ensued from 1984 to 1996. Eventually the actual former Galen Myers property got pretty close to entirely cleaned up; however, the huge inaccessible plume of contaminated groundwater was initially dealt with by issuing bottled water and installing various kinds of filters at affected houses. In 1995, EPA issued its Record of Decision, the formal plan for “what in God’s name we’re going to do about this mess,” and in 1996 its key provision was implemented, which was to pipe that water all the way out from bloody Mishawaka and hook up most of 200 houses. According to the 5YR, the people at 24 houses refused the city water initially, and 19 of these original intended beneficiary residences were still not on city water. Some people really hate paying water bills. I do hope they have filters.

Since the ROD went down in 1995, there have been four 5YRs written up at your expense. I participated in sampling for one of them… it must have been either preparations for the 2010 update, or possibly some sort of hanging chad from 2005. It’s a long drive from Indianapolis to Osceola, and a bit surreal to drive around a suburban neighborhood snooping for monitoring well covers. In any case, that’s the main deal these days: keep sampling and checking how fast the plume is moving.

The “exciting” new issue in soil and groundwater contamination in the last 15 years or so is soil vapor and indoor air hazards. The Galen Myers Superfund Site is finally catching up with the times. I did not read it, but there was an Addendum to the 5YR in the file documenting some soil gas sampling in the area. The idea at Galen Myers is that if you have groundwater with enough TCE in it, the TCE at the water table can and does evaporate and travel into the air spaces between soil particles. A house built over a hot enough plume can actually capture enough of that contaminant from the soil gas into its indoor air.

It keeps us environmental consultants busy, and will do so long into this new century.

How to Turn Your Rural Property into a Superfund Site in Three Easy Steps: The Galen Myers Story Part One

Note: the content of this post reflects the stories I heard and read about the site as its IDEM staff geologist between 2006 – 2009. In one or more future posts, I will provide additional details and any needed corrections from the extensive publicly available documentation on the site. Feel free to contact me with any corrections or additional lore. Concerns about the actual site should be made known to the U.S. EPA Chicago region office and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, with which I am no longer affiliated.

It was a different time in the 1970s. My students in introductory geology in the 2010s had never heard of the Superfund program, but in the 70s, it did not even exist yet. However, there were people in the U.S. so visionary, so forward thinking, that they were positioning their industrial sites and waste dumps for the program decades before it even came into being. Love Canal. The Valley of the Drums. Continental Steel.

For my money, though, the TRUE visionaries are those people, armed with little more than a small rural property and a squirrelly idea, who managed to make it big. Really big.

National Priorities List big.

Such a man was Galen Myers.

The wild and woolly strip of land was delivered from Michigan to Indiana at her birth so that she could have Michigan City, Portage, Gary, and access to Lake Michigan, but it stretches all the way to Ohio, so that South Bend could be at the very northern end of the state and so could Elkhart, Angola, and a quiet little place called Osceola (where the wind also comes sweeping down the plain). The landscape is dominated by low rolling hills and the St. Joseph River – the more famous of the two, although if your eye prowls a map, you’ll find another near the Ohio – Indiana line not far away. Both rivers are the gift of the glaciers, and came to exist in only the last 20,000 years or so. The St. Joseph we are concerned with flows over an astounding thickness of sand, left behind as the glaciers melted. It’s a beautiful place to drill a well. Hammer a pipe 20 feet into the ground, and you can pump water out as hard and as long as you like.

That kind of resource is handy in industry, and industry is what the region got in spades. South Bend got Studebaker and AM General. Elkhart got the RV manufacturers. There were many others. In the better living through chemistry(™) era of the 1940s and beyond, an ever more extensive array of chemicals were used in these industries, especially a delightful little chemical called tricholorethylene (since standardized to trichloroethene, and known as TCE to its friends).

Eventually, a clamor arose. These chemicals were doing nasty things to the places where they were being disposed. An entire new type of government agency, as is the custom, was erected to come up with a centrally planned set of solutions to the problem, including documenting what the wastes were and where they were going. The EPA was born in 1970, and industry groaned. It was so much easier when you could just dump all that stuff in a old quarry or something. (Oh, yes, we’ll get to Continental Steel.)

Galen Myers saw his chance to become a legend.

He owned a small patch of land in Osceola, right between Elkhart and South Bend. He started advertising a service: Galen Myers Dump and Drum Salvage. His business plan was beautifully simple.

    Accept a small fee along with those steel drums of waste.
    Kick the drums over in the back forty, hose them out, and sell them for use as trash cans.
    Profit!!!

All the liquid in those drums soaked into all that sand, and did what liquid contaminants do in the St. Joseph Valley: trickle straight down to the water table, then start following the groundwater flow straight toward the river.

Meanwhile, in 1980, the US EPA was given a massive mandate and a dedicated tax stream to go try to fix huge contaminated sites whose owners or responsible parties were either too poor to afford the cleanup or had fled the country. (We’ll get to Continental Steel in a few months, I promise.) The tax on chemicals that was imposed was paid into the Super Fund. While the actual Superfund didn’t last out the 1980s, the name has stuck. State agencies, seeing problems too big for them to handle, gained the opportunity to write up scoring documents demonstrating the size and danger of the sites in question, allowing them to be placed on the National Priority List of sites in the Superfund program.

Galen Myers died. His son sold the property to an unsuspecting citizen in the back of a bar for $10,000 cash. (Again, today I’m relaying the stories I’ve heard. In future episodes, I’ll get back to the question of whether I can substantiate this anecdote.)

Now, between the Galen Myers dump and the St. Joseph River are a few miles of sandy country, where c. 1970-1990 or so people built a lot of $100,000 houses back when that would buy you a starter mansion. Being ten miles out of town, all these folk were on wells.

Being in the path of Galen Myers’ TCE on its inevitable march to the river, TCE started showing up in some of their well water.

I don’t know whose eyes widened first at that office in Indianapolis, realizing that something had gotten out of hand, but IDEM, newly separated from the State Board of Health, got the case to the EPA, and the EPA got water piped out all the way from bloody Mishawaka, the aforementioned ten miles away. There was an unpleasant knock at the door when the EPA had to visit the new owner of the Galen Myers property. The residual contaminated soil at the property was taken away, but the plume remained. It was already on the order of a mile long, if memory serves.

There’s nothing practical you can do about a plume that big, in sand that permeable, other than stop using the groundwater and wait several decades. We’re still waiting. Every five years, test wells are sampled to see how far the plume has gotten. Someday it will reach the river, where it will get diluted and broken down by sunlight, and there will be an end to the legend of Galen Myers.

But if you want to live on for a century or two after you die, this is admittedly one way to do it.

Superfund Stories

Paul here. Just writing this intro for a new feature I’m planning for 2019.

As an environmental professional, you encounter a lot of stories. Every site has a story. No site gets contaminated without a story. What were people doing there, and what idea, whether clever, harebrained, reckless, or good-intentioned, led to the releases of toxic chemicals that we now have to deal with?

Even aside from contamination, every site has a story, what you can call urban archeology. In the Midwest, the story that we can find out about starts in the 19th century with white settlement in the area. Since then a contaminated site has frequently been used for a long, convoluted sequence of things, from cornfields to houses to railyards to factories to gas stations… Each site is a microcosm of economic history: everything that someone with gumption and the ability to talk someone out of enough cash to buy the place thought he (or she) could use it to turn a profit.

Obviously I couldn’t resist the (as far as I can tell, unused) alliteration Superfund Stories, and I plan to tell stories about a number of Superfund sites of my acquaintance (including Continental Steel, Galen Myers, and Lusher Street, but this blog won’t be limited to Superfund sites. Expect to see an entry once a month in 2019. Expect to be intrigued, concerned, and hopefully to learn a bit about Things Not To Do To Your Commercial Property.
